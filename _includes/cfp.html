                        Information systems have evolved into complex data platforms supporting end-to-end data-intensive needs, such as storage, computation, and analysis of data with heterogeneous structures.
                        However, a smart and comprehensive support for data scientists and architects to govern the data through the whole life-cycle is still necessary.

                        Supporting data management and governance requires the collection of metadata capturing the distinguishing features of the data; this enables advanced functionalities spanning from data research and profiling to provenance control, orchestration of data pipelines, incremental data integration, efficient querying, automated analytics, and homogeneous data access.
                        The challenges begin with metadata management in terms of the modeling effort, storage, complexity of retrieval activities, and effective exploitation.
                        While coping with big-data issues, the enabled functionalities must: (i) handle the heterogeneity of storage and computation engines (including DBMSs supporting multiple data models and cloud storage systems with limited control and predictability), (ii) meet suitability requirements for less-skilled users, and (iii) limit the costs of pay-as-you-go resources.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        This workshop calls for innovative solutions --- from researchers and practitioners --- that address the aforementioned challenges.
                        We welcome papers that contribute to the advancement of data platforms in engineering, optimizing, and simplifying the different aspects of data and metadata management and fruition.
