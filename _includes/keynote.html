                            Property graphs are a widespread data model for representing interconnected multi-labeled
                            data enhanced with properties as key/value pairs. These highly expressive graphs are used in
                            a wide range of domains, such as social and transportation networks, biological networks,
                            finance, cybersecurity, logistics and planning, to name a few. Property graphs are the
                            building blocks of future graph ecosystems, in which OLTP and OLAP processes are intertwined
                            with complex advanced processes, such as learning, scientific computing and business
                            intelligence.

                            While property graphs are currently used in a variety of graph databases, a rather
                            fragmented landscape emerges in terms of the supported query and schema languages. In
                            particular, the coverage of schema and constraints is limited if not completely lacking in
                            these systems. In this talk, I will present recent advances in terms of schemas and
                            constraints for property graphs, as part of our work within the LDBC community groups. I
                            will also focus on graph schema discovery and constraint satisfaction following these
                            proposals for property graph schema and constraints. Finally, I will pinpoint future
                            directions of research in this new exciting area of data management.
